machine-learning-fruit-sorting
This project is an engineering project combined with SolidWorks modeling and machine learning. 

The aim of this project is to sort fruit instantly through camera on the structure and quickly output a result of fruit's category, namely computer vision. I will mainly focus on the machine learning part and upload it here.

Basically, in the programming part, what I did is that I train a model by machine learning and connect it with sensors my built physical structure to implement the purpose of fruit sorting
